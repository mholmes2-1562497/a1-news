After the Las Vegas shooting, there has been a lot of conversation surrounding creating new policies on gun control. Historically, **the National Rifle Association**, N.R.A, has opposed impeding on the Second Amendment and has not supported new policies surrounding gun control. However, after the Las Vegas shooter was able to buy, _bump stocks_, or devices to allow rifles to fire like machine guns, the NRA is in support of banning these bump stocks. The N.R.A said in a statement:
> â€œThe N.R.A. believes that devices designed to allow semiautomatic rifles to function like fully-automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations."
